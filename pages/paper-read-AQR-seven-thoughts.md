Corey Hoffstein, host of one of my favorite podcast Flirting with Models, said if there was only one article on investing he could recommend, it would be this.

This paper, written by Cliff Asness (co-founder of AQR) in 2009, was updated from its prior 2007 version, for hopefully obvious reasons. While addressed to institutional investors, I thought it'd be interesting to read from a retail perspective. A belief of mine is that while large investors face larger pressures than what small investors face, those pressures are ultimately the same and because they're larger they're also more acutely felt; and easier to react against.
