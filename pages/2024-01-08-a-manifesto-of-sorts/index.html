May this year be the end of our long-running crises. For this year&#39;s first post, I want to do a bit of a reset.</p> <p>This website began as an amalgation of a few needs: I had ideas to write but wanted to flesh them out beyond my head, and tweets. I also wanted practice with web programming, especially after finding out github can host static sites. And I wanted some place to serve as a portfolio of sorts.</p> <p>So my starting approach to posts was to be clever: solve problems, do breakdowns, deep dives, things of that nature. As you can see from my posts so far, that didn&#39;t really work. My main issue was momentum: as it turns out, I burn out of ideas really quickly. So anytime there was grunt work involved, my brain tunes out. It&#39;s easier to grin and bear it to the finish line for work, less so as a hobby. I&#39;m still proud of the writing I did, especially <a href="http://localhost:8000/pages/2023-12-22-black-box-models-who-is-it-good-for">the one on black box models</a>. But the pace of writing to produce something like that again is not something I look forward to, for now. So moving on I&#39;m making a change, inspired by <a href="https://substack.com/@backofmind">Dan Davies&#39; substack</a>.</p> <p><strong>The idea for this blog is going to be the equivalent of lofi hip hop beats to relax/study to. Not so much giving takes regarding Great Debates with right and wrong answers, as funny little ideas that run in the background while youâ€™re working on something else. The topic will be whatever that fancies me, anything is fair game whether recently or ages ago. If it manages to come out as a post, the central idea was strong enough to survive entropy.</strong></p> <p>Obviously I&#39;m trying things out, but the goal is to loop myself into the creative process more often, and getting used to thinking during that loop. I&#39;ve seen <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/adrian-chiles-interview-column-ideas-man-bag">Adrian Chiles wring gold after gold out of sheer desperation</a>, and I want that for me.</p> <div class=page-foot > Last modified: January 08, 2024.
