Supposedly, when a quarter&#39;s about to end, funds managers and company owners want to show good performance in their holdings, so the stocks get played around by &quot;dealers&quot; to go up.</p> <p>It&#39;s worth noting that in Indonesia, the popular approaches to equity are fundamental or technical approaches, or the &quot;Bandarmologi&quot; approach &#40;translated literally as &quot;dealerology&quot;, it&#39;s part behavioral finance, part IDing market actors, part dubious stuff that might be banned in other countries&#41;. Quantitative approaches on the other hand, not so much.</p> <p>One consequence of this is different explanations for the same phenomenon: where one practitioner sees dealers in price movement, another might see genuine if temporary demand increase &#40;this is also my position&#41;.</p> <p>Back to the topic, I pulled IDX Composite index prices from 2010 to now, and checked close-to-close returns on the last business day of each quarter. I picked this because it&#39;s more actionable than daily returns &#40;only luck gets you filled on the day&#39;s open&#41;.</p> <p>From 2010 to 2019, there is a <strong>77.5&#37;</strong> chance you get a successful trade with an average return of <strong>0.5&#37;</strong>. But from 2020 to Q2 2023, the odds are only <strong>43&#37;</strong> with <strong>0.16&#37;</strong> average return. Why the changes after 2019? Besides COVID dragging prices down in 2020, my best guess for the subsequent years is <a href="https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/market/20220114152218-17-307432/investor-ritel-memang-naik-tapi-yang-aneh-aneh-makin-banyak">the recent increase in retail money entering the market</a>, which would obfuscate the fund managers&#39; effect.</p> <div class=page-foot > Last modified: December 28, 2023.
